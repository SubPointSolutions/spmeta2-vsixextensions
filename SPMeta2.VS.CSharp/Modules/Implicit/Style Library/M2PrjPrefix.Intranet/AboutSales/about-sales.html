<b>#1 Listen to your customers.</b><br />
Your work doesn’t end by selling your product. But it is after selling the product that your true customer service comes into picture. Always give your ears to your customers and ask what you can do to serve them better.<br />
<br />


<b>#2 Look at all complaints about your service as an opportunity to improve.</b><br />
No one knows your product better than your customers. They are your true critics. Aim to resolve all the customer complaints quickly and efficiently. Remember – the customers’ perception is your reality!<br />
<br />


<b>#3 Surprise customers with a bonus.</b><br />

When people spend money on a product, the last thing you want them to think is, “Was it really worth?” To combat this, you should surprise each of your customers with a little bonus. Say for example, when paying the bill in a restaurant, if the waiter gives you a mint for free, you keep more tip than usual. Sometimes small surprises make big differences.<br />
