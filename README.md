### The story and experience
Whenever you build a proof-of-concept, corporate intranet or six-figures project on top of SharePoint platform, 
[SPMeta2/M2]("https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/spmeta2") is all you need to deploy SharePoint artefacts in most enjoyable, smooth, testable and repeatable way. [SPMeta2]("https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/spmeta2") is a .NET library that offers a  hassle-free fluent API supporting not only SharePoint 2010, 2013 and O365, but also CSOM and SSOM. It is the first building block to well-structured and consistent projects.

We learnt a lot while providing SPMeta2 support to independent consultants, small start-ups, ISVs, SharePoint consultancy companies as well as large enterprises with six-figures projects across the globe. Consequently, a well-structured approach to create, develop, maintain and support SPMeta2 project was born. Later on, it was encapsulated into Visual Studio snippets and project templates, so that other people can have the same positive and enjoyable experience not only starting projects from scratch, but also supporting and enhancing already existing ones. This is our second building block to well-structured and consistent projects.

In nutshell, there are a few project template to get your SharePoint project started in a few clicks from the avialable templates:

Then we ask if you want to onclude provision and desired SharePoint runtime, or go plain POCO deciding on provision later:
